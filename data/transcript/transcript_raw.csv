01," And now, yes, we can begin the lesson. Alright. This is it. Exactly. Okay. But anyway, happy, happy Wednesday, my dear. It's another, you know, class, alright, for the week, right? So, but before we begin, alright, how was your week so far? Because we are in the middle part of it, you know. We call it hump day. Yeah. Right? So, how was it?
