##=====>Error Analysis

After reviewing several sentences from intermediate-level students, the most frequent errors can be identified as follows:

### 1. Verb Tense Consistency Error
- Example: Student's sentence: "I has eaten breakfast already."
  - Corrected sentence: "I have eaten breakfast already."
- Brief explanation: Students often switch between different verb tenses within a single sentence, leading to inconsistency. This error can be due to a lack of understanding of verb tense rules or poor time management while speaking.
- Frequency: High frequency

### 2. Subject-Verb Agreement Error
- Example: Student's sentence: "The students are study for the exam."
  - Corrected sentence: "The students are studying for the exam."
- Brief explanation: Students sometimes forget to agree subject-verb when using plural or singular subjects, resulting in grammatical issues.
- Frequency: Medium to high frequency

### 3. Overuse or Misuse of Vocabulary
- Example: Student's sentence: "I'm really feel happy today."
  - Corrected sentence: "I'm feeling really happy today."
- Brief explanation: Intermediate-level students often misuse or overuse vocabulary, especially with emotional expressions or nuances. This could result in misinterpretation of intended meaning.
- Frequency: Medium to high frequency

### 4. Preposition Error
- Example: Student's sentence: "The book are on the table."
  - Corrected sentence: "The books are on the table."
- Brief explanation: Students often struggle with preposition usage and placement, which can change the meaning of the sentence significantly.
- Frequency: Medium frequency

##=====>Pedagogical Rule
"If a student makes the Verb Tense Consistency Error more than 3 times, suggest an exercise on Verb Tense Review, focusing on identifying and correcting tense errors within a single sentence."
